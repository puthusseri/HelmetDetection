# HelmetDetection

## Introduction

This is a simple project to detect a helmet in an image.

It will be easy to use an object detection model like yolo, or a trained models like VGG.
But Im trying to buikd my own model . At first I will focus on classifying an image with helmet and without helmet. 
Then will go for detecting a helmet in an image.
